# Nick's First CS193 Homework


## Favorite Things About CS193
- Friends in class
- Cool room, had one of my PSP callouts in there
- Downward sloping floor perfect for sending dropped water bottles tumbling down towards the professor
- TAs are actually understandable and don't speak in the world's thickest and most incomprehensible accent unlike nearly all of my other TAs
